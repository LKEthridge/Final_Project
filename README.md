In the competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is vital to long-term success. This project helps Interconnect Telecom proactively address customer churn by building a machine learning model that predicts which clients are likely to discontinue service—enabling the company to target those customers with timely retention offers.

Using a dataset of over 7,000 customers including demographics, contract details, and usage metrics, the data was cleaned, explored, and feature-engineered to support effective modeling. Five machine learning models were evaluated, with CatBoost delivering the best performance, achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.904—a strong result despite class imbalance.

Key churn predictors include contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and total charges. Notably, customers on month-to-month contracts are at significantly higher risk of leaving. The final model estimates that ~20% of current customers are at risk, offering Interconnect a critical opportunity to intervene.

With this solution, Interconnect can move from reactive to proactive churn prevention, using targeted offers to retain high-risk customers and improve long-term revenue stability.
